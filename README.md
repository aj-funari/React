LinkedIn Learning --> Learning React.js
1) React is used to create user interfaces
2) Package manager --> Node.js
3) 'package.json' contains all the project's dependencies
4) The source folder contains all the files we will use to write the application
5) Building for production, all files will be put into public folder
6) npm start --> run react application
7) React Developer Tools --> Chrome Extension
8) When we're designing React applications for real, we start creating user interfaces with collections of React elements called components. A component lets you put together user interface with independent reusable pieces. A component is a function that returns some UI. 
-Components ALWAYS need to be capitalized.
9) Props, or properties, is an object in React that contains properties about the component. With props we can display dynamic data within a component. --> pass 'props' argument to component
10) Keys help React keep track of which items have changed, have been added or removed. 
-A key is an identifier for a dynamically created element.
11) ternary if statement --> Before the question mark is the condition, after the question mark is the component that we want to render if that condition is true.
12) A hook is a function that allows you to add functionality to a component.
13) useState is a built-in hook that we can use to handle state changes in our application. 
-first value returned: the state value
-second value returned: the function to change the state
14) useEffect allows us to perform effects inside our function conponents
15) A reducer function's most simple definition is that it takes in the current state, and returns a new state. 
16) Deploy a React app --> build project, Netlify
